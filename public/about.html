<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm form my beloved amazing coutry: Brazil!</p>
  <p>I'm a biologist who works with reforestation in Campinas's municipal water and sewage treatment company.</p>
  <p>I got my masters degree in ecology studying a specie of ogre-faced spider habits and population ecology.</p>

  <p>My hobby is to grow plants, play guitar and study history and political economy. </p>

<p>Recently I took an interest in coding and web development and I'm looking for a career transition to this 
  area in order to catch up to the tecnology available nowdays and to use it in personal and 
  work related projects.

<p>Hope you enjoy my portfolio. It's simple but it has a lot of heart!</p>
<p>Good day!</p>
